# RPG-Game
This is an RPG I create utilizing Unity and some Udemy courses.

This is the Game Demo explanation!

On the Main Menu you start a ***New Game****

You spawn in the middle of the town, you can explore around and check the map I created for the demo (most of the assets used in the game were given to me in my udemy courses, some of the weapons, potions and armor, as well as the gold coins, I created them utilizing Aesprite).

**CONTROLS**

Left Click - Accept
Right Click - Cancel
Esc - Menu
WASD/Arrow Keys - Movement

**EQUIPMENT**

Now, I would recommend you to gear the main character up and the side character before continuing with the quest. You can do so by:

Either going to your equipment. ![image](https://github.com/CarlosAvila185/RPG-Game/assets/77648354/e346232a-213f-4059-a794-869414d559cb) selecting Equip ![image](https://github.com/CarlosAvila185/RPG-Game/assets/77648354/9a890926-2b49-47ac-80f6-c29ca43ad749) and choosing a character ![image](https://github.com/CarlosAvila185/RPG-Game/assets/77648354/01c87a5a-4a26-444b-bda9-a1bab459289b)

Or going to Party Equipment, clicking "Change Loadout"

and choosing a piece of armor/weapon you want to use.

**SHOP**

Another feature I implemented was a shop system.

If you visit the house right next to where the NPC with the quest is standing, and approach the door you will be able to enter the house.

Once inside, you can speak with the shopkeeper, by approaching the desk and left clicking, this will bring up their shop, from where you can shop their wares, sell your items or equipment for gold.

**MAIN QUEST**

You can talk to this NPC to start the "demo quest".

You can check all your Active/Completed/Failed Quests in the Quests Tab.

Additionally, you can check:

- The possible rewards
- The quest title and description
- The name of the NPC
- The recommended Level for the quest.
- Finally, you can also set the quest as your favorite to see it when you open the Menu.

By starting the quest, the boulder in front of the cave (in the map north from the town) will disappear, allowing you to go in and fight some monsters!
